        Hey, I’m Alec Garnica — a mixing engineer, producer, and audio nerd
        who’s been at it for the past 13 years. Over the years I’ve had the
        chance to work with some amazing artists like
        <strong>American Arson, Philip Bowen, and the Scally Brothers</strong>,
        as well as with <strong>Facedown Records</strong> and even on film
        trailers like <em>Eternal Theater</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I mostly work in the world of
        <strong>rock, pop, punk, and pop-rock</strong>, and I love crafting
        mixes that are polished, modern, and full of energy. My style has been
        shaped by learning under some legendary names in the industry like
        <strong>Chris Lord-Alge, Dave Hagen, and Tim Padalin</strong> — so I put
        the same level of care and punch into every project I take on.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I mix, my goal is simple:
        <strong>bring your song to life.</strong> I want it to have feel and
        soul, while still sounding massive and ready to compete in today’s music
        landscape.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work out of my studio just outside of Detroit, but thanks to the
        beauty of the internet, I collaborate with artists all over the world.
        Besides mixing, I also offer
        <strong>editing, backtracking synth production, and re-amping</strong>
        to help you get your songs exactly where you want them.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of the day, I’m here to make your music shine. Let’s make
        something incredible together.
